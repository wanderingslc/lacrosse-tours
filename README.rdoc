Code for the splitdodgetours website. For the split dodge tours company
who runs a fun bus from Salt Lake City Utah to Denver so lacrosse fans 
can see professional games and shop stores that aren't in the smaller 
lacrosse markets yet. 
     Simple website with basic pages and a contact mailer, admin area
will be added instead of using a larger CMS framework that's simply overkill
for what the client needed.
